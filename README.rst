Rotation Period Evolution in Low-Mass Binary Stars: The Impact of Tidal Torques and Magnetic Braking
====================================================================================================

We examine how tides, stellar evolution, and magnetic braking shape the rotation
period (Prot) evolution of low-mass stellar binaries up to orbital periods
(Porb) of 100 d across a wide range tidal dissipation parameters using two
common equilibrium tidal models. We find that many binaries with Porb
~20 d tidally-lock, and most with Porb < 4 d tidally-lock into
synchronous rotation on circularized orbits. At short Porb, tidal torques
produce a population of fast rotators that single-star only models of magnetic
braking fail to produce.  In many cases, we show that the competition between
magnetic braking and tides produces a population of subsynchronous rotators that
persists for Gyrs, even in short Porb binaries, qualitatively reproducing
the subsynchronous eclipsing binaries (EBs) discovered in the Kepler field by
Lurie et al. (2017). Both equilibrium tidal models predict that binaries can
tidally-interact out to Porb ~80 d, while the CPL equilibrium tidal
model predicts that binaries can tidally-lock out to Porb ~100 d.
Tidal torques often force the Prot evolution of stellar binaries to depart
from the long-term magnetic braking-driven spin down experienced by single
stars, revealing that Prot is not be a valid proxy for age in all cases,
i.e. gyrochronology methods can fail unless one accounts for binarity. We
suggest that accurate determinations of orbital eccentricties and Prot can
be used to discriminate between which equilibrium tidal models best describes
tidal interactions in low-mass binary stars.
